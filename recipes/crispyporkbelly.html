<h2>The Best Crispy Pork Belly</h2>
    <p>Thanks to social media, food bloggers, and celebrity chefs with too much time on their hands, pork belly was/is all the rage. It's a common sight on menus across the land, and you can't channel-surf past a food show without seeing it.</p>
    
    <p>It also helps that people are no longer terrified to eat a little fat.</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound whole pork belly, skin removed</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon smoked paprika, or to taste</li>
        <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste</li>
    </ul> 
    
<h3>Steps:</h3>   
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Season pork belly all over with smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper. Wrap pork in parchment paper; wrap a second time in aluminum foil, and a third time in another sheet of aluminum foil. Place pork packet in a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until tender for 6 hours. Let cool in wrappings to room temperature; place cooled packet in refrigerator and chill for 8 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Unwrap chilled meat. Save any rendered fat that falls away when unwrapping pork.</li>
        <li>Cut meat into 6 equal-size portions. Cut 1/8-inch by 1/8-inch slashes in the fat-side of the pork. Season with salt.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons reserved pork fat in a skillet over medium heat. Place pork belly, fat side down, in hot fat; cook until well-browned on all sides and heated through, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer pork belly to a plate, drizzle with olive oil and season with pepper.</li>
    </ol>
